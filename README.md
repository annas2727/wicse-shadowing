# wicse-shadowing
I am creating an audio visualizer overlay application to visualize 3D sounds in video games. My project uses ML to analyze the frequencies of sound to determine where the sounds are coming from. This project is part of the WiCSE Shadowing Program and I am under the supervision of an engineer from American Express.
